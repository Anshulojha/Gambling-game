## Overview

This README provides an outline for creating a Python program for a game. The game involves generating random numbers, constructing a 2D grid using alphabets, storing spin data in a database, and displaying the game on a user interface.

Please note that this is a high-level overview. Detailed instructions, code, and framework usage are not provided in this document.

## Installation and Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `python manage.py runserver`.
3. Access the game via your web browser at the URL provided in your terminal.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have Python and Django installed on your system.

## Key Components

### 1. Random Number Generation

- The first number must be a random integer.
- The second number must be a factor of the first number.
- The third number must be the product of the first two numbers.
- The fourth number can be any random number.
- The fifth number must be the smallest among all numbers generated so far.
- The sixth number can be any random number.

### 2. Creating the Grid

Prepare six strips of alphabets, including:
1. English uppercase letters (A-Z).
2. English lowercase letters (a-z).
3. Greek alphabet characters (24 characters).
4. A strip containing a random combination of characters.
5. Roman numerals and letters (e.g., I, V, X, L, C, D, M).
6. Another strip of Roman numerals and letters.

Use the generated random numbers to select characters from each strip to populate a 2D grid (6x3).

### 3. Database Integration

- Use SQLite as the database to store spin data.
- Create a table in the database to store spin data, including the random numbers generated and the resulting grid.

### 4. User Interface (UI)

- Utilize Django as the UI framework to create the game's user interface.
- Design and implement the UI to display the grid and spin data to the user.

### 5. Game Logic

Implement the game logic, which may include:
- Tracking wins, losses, and payout calculations based on the generated grid.

### 6. Documentation

Attached comprehensive documentation for this game includes:
- Explanations of how the game works.
- Instructions on how to use the program.
- Setup instructions for any necessary libraries or components.

### 7. Testing and Debugging

- Thoroughly test the program to ensure it functions as expected.
- If you encounter any issues or bugs, please create an issue on the repository.

### 8. Deployment

- If the program is web-based, deploy it on a web server.
- For desktop applications, package it for distribution to users.
